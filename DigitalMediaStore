#For this project, I downloaded a database dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, 
invoices, customers, employees, genres, and playlists. Then, I extracted various insights from the data. 

/* 1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';

/* 2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

/* 3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, InvoiceID, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry
FROM customers
JOIN invoices
ON customers.CustomerID = invoices.CustomerID
WHERE BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

/* 4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT EmployeeId, FirstName, LastName, Title 
FROM employees
WHERE Title like '%Sales%' AND Title like '%Agent%';

/* 5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM invoices;

/* 6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT InvoiceId, employees.FirstName, employees.LastName
FROM invoices
JOIN customers ON invoices.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID
JOIN employees ON employees.EmployeeID = customers.SupportRepID;

/*7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT Total, customers.FirstName as 'Customer First Name', customers.LastName as 'Customer Last Name', customers.Country, employees.FirstName as 'Agent First Name', employees.LastName as 'Agent Last Name'
FROM invoices
JOIN customers ON invoices.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID
JOIN employees ON employees.EmployeeID = customers.SupportRepID;

/* 8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '2009%';

/* 9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total) 
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '2009%';

/* 10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT tracks.Name, invoice_items.InvoiceLineID
FROM tracks
JOIN invoice_items ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.TrackID;

/* 11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT tracks.Name as 'Track', artists.Name as 'Artist Name', invoice_items.InvoiceLineID
FROM tracks
JOIN invoice_items ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.TrackID
JOIN albums ON albums.ALBUMId = tracks.AlbumID
JOIN artists ON artists.ArtistID = albums.ArtistID;


/* 12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT tracks.Name as Track, albums.Title as Album, media_types.Name as MediaType, genres.Name as Genre
FROM tracks
JOIN albums ON albums.AlbumID = tracks.AlbumID
JOIN media_types ON media_types.MediaTypeID = tracks.MediaTypeID
JOIN genres ON genres.GenreID = tracks.GenreID;

/* 13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, ROUND(SUM(invoices.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM employees
JOIN customers ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeID
JOIN invoices ON invoices.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID
GROUP BY employees.FirstName;


/* 14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009? 

SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, ROUND(SUM(invoices.Total), 2) as TotalSales
FROM employees
JOIN customers ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeID
JOIN invoices ON invoices.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID
WHERE invoices.InvoiceDate like '2009%'
GROUP BY employees.FirstName
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
LIMIT 1;
